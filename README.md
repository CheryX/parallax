# parallax
Short TypeScript snippet to make your website theme scroll with a parallax effect.

## Usage
1. Add a container element with the ID "source" â€” this is your main content.
2. Include this script at the end of the <body>.
3. Configure `sectionIds` and `velocity` below.
4. Style your themed blocks using the format: `${sectionId}-plx`.
For examples, refer to index.html in the project root.
